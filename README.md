# Architecting Global Scale Web and Mobile Solutions on Azure
One of the main benefits of the Microsoft Azure platform is its massive scale.  Microsoft Azure runs on a massive network of over many regions worldwide. This global reach makes it possible to create solutions on a global scale that meet your demanding performance requirements.  We will discuss architectural patterns that lend themselves to global geo-located solutions and the specific features of Microsoft Azure that enable geo-replicated data.
